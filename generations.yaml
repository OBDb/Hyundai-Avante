    description: "The original Hyundai Avante was essentially a rebadged version of the first-generation Elantra for specific markets, primarily South Korea. Featuring conservative, boxy styling typical of early 1990s compact sedans, it was positioned as an affordable family car. Powered by a range of four-cylinder engines typically between 1.5L and 1.8L displacement, it offered modest performance focused on reliability and economy. The interior was basic but functional, with a straightforward dashboard design and durable materials. This generation established the Avante nameplate in its home market, where it would eventually become one of Hyundai's core models."
